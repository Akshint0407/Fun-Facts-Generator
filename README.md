## Troubleshooting Tips

### Fun Facts Not Displaying?
- **Check Script Link:** Ensure that `script.js` is correctly linked in your `index.html`. The script tag should be placed right before the closing `</body>` tag.
- **Check Facts Array:** Ensure each fun fact in the `facts` array is enclosed in quotes and separated by commas. Incorrect formatting can prevent the facts from being displayed.

### Site Not Loading on GitHub Pages?
- **Confirm Source Branch:** Make sure youâ€™ve set the source to the main branch in your GitHub Pages settings.
- **Check URL Format:** Ensure your GitHub Pages URL is correctly formatted. It should look like `https://yourusername.github.io/fun-facts/`. Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username and `fun-facts` with your repository name.
